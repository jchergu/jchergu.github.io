# Logbook

For all the information about Jacopo, please check the website. In this log file, we will focus on the building process of the website, developing a timeline of the incremental progress. 

The approach is to build something very slowly, but not for lazyness. 
The main reasons are:
1. Constantly review **details**, focusing on quality and not on 'fancy' functionalities just to impress at a superficial level.
2. The focus is on building something **modular**, that works independently from the estetics or colour palette. So, we will focus more on the architecture. Initially, the changes made every time will seem not very noticeable, but in reality there's always something cooking.
3. ***Ars longa, vita brevis***. This could appear as an excuse to slowness and chill out instead of 'doing things', but the reality is that if I don't spend time on development, I'm spending time in studying, reading or even other aspects of life that enrich my cultural baggage, and this is a benefit for the website and the other projects I work on. This could be a course about tech stuff, playing/studying music, a nature-filled journey, sport activities or even just relax - nothing is lost.

This is the manifesto. Will I regret this philosophy? Until is applied to my personal projects, there are no negative effects. I will make mistakes, yes, but I'm learning to embrace them, and make them a point of improvement.

### The Idea
Why should I develop a website about ME? What do I have to tell to the entire world? And why should a person spend few minutes on this?

Obviously, building a website is educational for me, but this doesn't explain why the website is about me:
1. **Tech**: As a computer engineer, I need to show in a practical way what can I do, and here I can insert my projects and put them together in a portfolio.
2. **Music**: As a music-passionated (both to play music and listen to), I would love to share my passion showing my musical projects, new music from others I love but also some reflections on how music is changing with technology.
3. **Log**: I want to journal everything to dive in the decision-process. I love when other people do things like "oh, I decided to do X because of Y, but then I found the error Z and decided to change...". Wonderful.

### The first prototype
Very simple: 
- `README.md`
- `index.html`

### The structure
While studying Cloud Computing and Turkish language, I'm thinking of setting up the first structure:
- `portfolio.html` to show my tech projects
- `music.html` to show my music
- `blog.html` because I have some things to tell to the world
- `about.html` because it's cool

But I'm still thinking about how to apply the CSS before doing disasters, there are many options... I've heard about tailwind css, but also figma. I have to inform better.


## August 2025

### After the holidays
In this period, I've learned a little bit about Tailwind CSS and used it in `index.html`. My decision is to first decide some style of the home page and then complete the other sections: music, portfolio, blog, about.
